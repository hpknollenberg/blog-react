      <h4>What did you learn about that helped you understand the
          development process? </h4>
      <p>This week we developed our skills further concerning JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML.
        We also learned about APIs and how to interact with them. This week I felt far more
        comfortable working with CSS and Bootstrap; I felt like I could envision what I wanted and
        could quickly make meaningful steps toward that goal. </p><br></br>
      <h4>What does it mean to develop good code?</h4>
      <p>Developing good code is developing readable code that either meets the MVP or goes
        beyond it.</p><br></br>
      <h4>What does it mean to be a good developer? </h4>
      <p>Being a good developer is being able to work well with others and to develop good code.</p><br></br>
      <h4>What is one thing that programmers hate doing?</h4>
      <p>â€™m not terribly certain what this question is referring to, but what I would assume most
        programmers hate doing is having to parse through unreadable code. </p>
